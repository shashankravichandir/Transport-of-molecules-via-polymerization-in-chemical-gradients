This folder contains two videos of animations of partially active polymer-

1. N3.mp4 - polymer with N=3 and the middle monomer active (shows antichemotaxis)
2. N7.mp4 - polymer with N=7 and the end monomer active (shows chemotaxis)

The simulations are done in a 2D square box with x and y ranging from 0 to L = 100, and the activity varies only along the x axis as f_s(x) = 20(1+ sin(2\pi x/L)).
